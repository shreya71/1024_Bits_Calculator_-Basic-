# 1024_Bits_Calculator_-Basic-

A code that calculates addition and subtraction operations for big numbers. 
Results for substraction are given with signs according the the inouts given.
eg:-
     if,
     input 1 > input 2
     so here after subtracting result > 0
     if, input 1 < input 2
     since here result is negative a '-' sign is shown in output
** Also, it checks the overflow, i.e., if the number entered or sum of the numbers exceed 2^1024-1, it gives an error. It is a 1024 bit calculator so it won't take a        number greater than 2^1024-1, also it will not give result if it exceeds 2^1024-1.

********* Further Changes to be Done **********
 
 Soon the code for multiplication will be included.
